This manuscript analyzes the metadata for human RNA-seq studies from two public databases — the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) — to document and highlight biases in our understanding and representation of human transcriptomic variation.

All scripts are provided in the “code” folder. Data required as input for the manual review script is posted in the “processed_data” folder. In all other cases, the input files are hosted on Figshare and is available at https://figshare.com/s/5eab0288a3c910543461. Outputs from R scripts or R markdown scripts are located in the “output” folder. 

Note that the specific paths in the scripts will not work on your computer and you will need to change them accordingly.
